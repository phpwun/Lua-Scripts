# Rbxl/Functional Directory

This directory contains scripts specifically designed for functional purposes within Roblox's LuaU environment. These scripts handle complex calculations and back-end mechanics necessary for game development.

## Scripts Overview

### `Decompiler.lua`
**Function:** Assists in decompiling Lua bytecode, enabling developers to analyze and potentially modify compiled Lua scripts. Useful for reverse engineering or debugging purposes.

### `INVERSEKINE.lua`
**Function:** Implements inverse kinematics solutions, which are essential for realistic articulation of joints in character animations or mechanical simulations within Roblox.

## Usage

These scripts are designed to be integrated into Roblox Studio. To use them:

1. Open Roblox Studio and your project.
2. Import the scripts into the appropriate part of your game.
3. Adjust the scripts as needed to fit your game mechanics or animation requirements.
