This folder contains Lua scripts specifically designed for Roblox's LuaU environment. It includes both functional and visual scripts aimed at game development within Roblox.

## Directory Structure

- **Rbxl/Functional**: Contains scripts for backend functionalities like decompiling and inverse kinematics calculations, which are critical for dynamic movements and game mechanics.
- **Rbxl/Visual**: Houses scripts for creating and managing visual elements and models within Roblox games, enhancing the graphical interface and user experience.

## Scripts Overview

### Functional Directory

#### `Decompiler.lua`
Provides functionality for decompiling Lua bytecode, which can be useful for analyzing or recovering source code from compiled Lua files.
